    "q2)Abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It focuses on \"what\" an object does rather than \"how\" it does it. In simpler terms, abstraction allows you to represent the essential features of an object while hiding the irrelevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a car as an object. When you're driving a car, you don't need to know the intricate details of how the engine works or how the transmission system operates. Instead, you only need to know how to use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift to control the car. In this scenario, the car is abstracted, and you interact with it based on its essential functionalities like steering, accelerating, and braking, without worrying about its internal mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   Encapsulation is the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It's about wrapping the data and methods together and controlling access to them. Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding and prevents external code from directly accessing the internal state of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   Let's continue with the example of a car. In an object-oriented programming language like Python, you can encapsulate the properties and behaviors of a car using a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Car:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "           self.make = make\n",
    "           self.model = model\n",
    "           self.speed = 0  # encapsulated property\n",
    "\n",
    "       def accelerate(self, amount):\n",
    "           self.speed += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "       def brake(self, amount):\n",
    "           self.speed -= amount\n",
    "\n",
    "       def get_speed(self):  # encapsulated method\n",
    "           return self.speed\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Creating an instance of Car\n",
    "   my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Using the encapsulated methods to interact with the object\n",
    "   my_car.accelerate(20)\n",
    "   print(\"Current speed:\", my_car.get_speed())  # Output: Current speed: 20\n",
    "   my_car.brake(5)\n",
    "   print(\"Current speed:\", my_car.get_speed())  # Output: Current speed: 15\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `Car` class encapsulates the properties (`make`, `model`, `speed`) and methods (`accelerate`, `brake`, `get_speed`). The internal state of the car (like `speed`) is encapsulated within the class, and external code interacts with the car object through defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, abstraction focuses on hiding unnecessary details, while encapsulation bundles data and methods together and controls access to them. Both concepts are crucial for building robust and maintainable object-oriented software systems.\n",

    "# No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly in most object-oriented programming languages. Abstract classes are designed to serve as blueprints for other classes and are incomplete on their own, typically containing one or more abstract methods. Abstract methods are methods without a body, meaning they only have a signature but no implementation. Abstract classes are meant to be extended by other classes, which provide concrete implementations for the abstract methods.\n",

They serve as a blueprint that outlines the structure and behavior of the subclasses. Creating instances of abstract classes would not make sense because they lack full implementations.\n",

You can have concrete subclasses like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, etc., that extend the `Shape` class and provide implementations for `calculate_area()`. But you can't have an instance of `Shape` because it's not fully defined.\n",
