    "### Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flask** is a micro web framework for Python. It is lightweight and modular, allowing developers to use it as a starting point for web applications. Flask provides essential components, like routing and request handling, but leaves the developer with the flexibility to choose other components or extend the framework as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Flask:**\n",
    "- **Lightweight and Simple:** Flask has a minimalistic core, making it easy to learn and use, especially for small applications or for developers who prefer more control over components.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Flask doesn't impose a strict project structure, allowing developers to build their applications in whatever way suits them best.\n",
    "- **Extensibility:** Flask can be easily extended with various plugins and libraries to add functionality as needed.\n",
    "- **Documentation:** Flask has well-written documentation that is beginner-friendly.\n",
    "- **Community Support:** Flask has a large and active community, providing a wealth of tutorials, extensions, and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’. Attach the screenshot of the output in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple Flask application:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    return 'Hello World!!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the output, run the Flask application, and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser. The page will display \"Hello World!!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To display the output in a Jupyter Notebook, you can run the Flask application and then take a screenshot of the browser displaying the \"Hello World!!\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is App Routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**App Routing** in Flask refers to the mechanism used to map URLs to functions in your application. These functions are typically referred to as view functions because they define what content or functionality should be displayed or performed when a specific URL is accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use App Routes?**\n",
    "- **URL Mapping:** Routes help in mapping URLs to specific Python functions that handle requests.\n",
    "- **Organizing Code:** They allow developers to organize code logically by associating different functions with different URLs.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Content:** Routes can take parameters, enabling the creation of dynamic URLs that respond to different user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Create a “/welcome” route to display the welcome message “Welcome to ABC Corporation” and a “/” route to show the following details:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def company_details():\n",
    "    return '''\n",
    "    Company Name: ABC Corporation<br>\n",
    "    Location: India<br>\n",
    "    Contact Detail: 999-999-9999\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "def welcome():\n",
    "    return 'Welcome to ABC Corporation'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this application:\n",
    "- Visiting `http://127.0.0.1:5000/welcome` will display \"Welcome to ABC Corporation\".\n",
    "- Visiting `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` will display the company details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attach a screenshot of the output as displayed in your browser after running the Flask app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What function is used in Flask for URL Building? Write a Python code to demonstrate the working of the `url_for()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Used for URL Building:**\n",
    "The `url_for()` function in Flask is used to build a URL for a specific function dynamically. It’s particularly useful when you want to generate URLs for functions based on their names instead of hardcoding URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return 'This is the home page'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/about')\n",
    "def about():\n",
    "    return 'This is the about page'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/contact')\n",
    "def contact():\n",
    "    return 'This is the contact page'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/generate_urls')\n",
    "def generate_urls():\n",
    "    home_url = url_for('index')\n",
    "    about_url = url_for('about')\n",
    "    contact_url = url_for('contact')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return f\"Home: {home_url}<br>About: {about_url}<br>Contact: {contact_url}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- Visiting `http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate_urls` will display the dynamically generated URLs for the `index`, `about`, and `contact` functions. The `url_for()` function is used to generate these URLs."
