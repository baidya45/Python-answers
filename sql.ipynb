    "### Q1. What is a Database? Differentiate Between SQL and NoSQL Databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database**: \n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Databases are used to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Databases**:\n",
    "- **Structure**: Relational, uses tables with fixed schemas.\n",
    "- **Language**: SQL (Structured Query Language).\n",
    "- **Schema**: Rigid, predefined schema required.\n",
    "- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\n",
    "- **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL Databases**:\n",
    "- **Structure**: Non-relational, supports various data models like document, key-value, column-family, and graph.\n",
    "- **Language**: Varies (e.g., MongoDB Query Language, CQL for Cassandra).\n",
    "- **Schema**: Flexible, dynamic schema.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Often eventual consistency, some support ACID.\n",
    "- **Examples**: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison**:\n",

    "### Q2. What is DDL? Explain Why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are Used with an Example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DDL (Data Definition Language)**: \n",
    "DDL commands are used to define the structure of the database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CREATE**: Used to create a new table or database.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "      EmployeeID int,\n",
    "      FirstName varchar(255),\n",
    "      LastName varchar(255),\n",
    "      BirthDate date\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DROP**: Used to delete a table or database.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",

    "  ```sql\n",
    "  ALTER TABLE Employees ADD Email varchar(255);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TRUNCATE**: Used to remove all records from a table, but the table structure remains.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an Example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: \n",
    "DML commands are used to manipulate data stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **INSERT**: Used to insert new records into a table.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, BirthDate)\n",
    "  VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '1980-01-01');\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UPDATE**: Used to modify existing records in a table.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  UPDATE Employees\n",
    "  SET Email = 'john.doe@example.com'\n",
    "  WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an Example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQL (Data Query Language)**: \n",
    "DQL commands are used to query the database for retrieving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SELECT**: Used to select data from a database.\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Key**: A primary key is a field (or combination of fields) in a table that uniquely identifies each row/record in that table. It cannot contain NULL values and must contain unique values.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "      EmployeeID int PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      FirstName varchar(255),\n",
    "      LastName varchar(255)\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a field (or combination of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE Orders (\n",
    "      OrderID int PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      OrderDate date,\n",
    "      EmployeeID int,\n",
    "      FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID)\n",

    "### Q6. Write a Python Code to Connect MySQL to Python. Explain the `cursor()` and `execute()` Method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish the connection\n",
    "connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "    user=\"yourusername\",\n",
    "    password=\"yourpassword\",\n",
    "    database=\"yourdatabase\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a cursor object\n",
    "cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute a query\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM Employees\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch the results\n",
    "results = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "for row in results:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the cursor and connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`cursor()`**: The `cursor()` method creates a cursor object, which is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results.\n",
    "- **`execute()`**: The `execute()` method is used to execute a single SQL query. You pass the query string to this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Give the Order of Execution of SQL Clauses in an SQL Query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical order of execution of SQL clauses in a query is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM**: Specifies the tables to retrieve data from.\n",
    "2. **JOIN**: Joins tables based on a related column.\n",
    "3. **WHERE**: Filters records based on specified conditions.\n",
    "4. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows sharing a property so that an aggregate function can be applied to each group.\n",
    "5. **HAVING**: Filters groups based on specified conditions.\n",
    "6. **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to be returned.\n",
    "7. **DISTINCT**: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.\n",
    "8. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set based on specified columns.\n",
    "9. **LIMIT**: Limits the number of rows returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example SQL Query Execution Order\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT FirstName, COUNT(*)\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "JOIN Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID\n",
    "WHERE Employees.BirthDate > '1980-01-01'\n",
    "GROUP BY FirstName\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(*) > 1\n",
    "ORDER BY FirstName ASC\n",
    "LIMIT 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FROM**: Employees\n",
    "- **JOIN**: Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID\n",
    "- **WHERE**: Employees.BirthDate > '1980-01-01'\n",
    "- **GROUP BY**: FirstName\n",
    "- **HAVING**: COUNT(*) > 1\n",
    "- **SELECT**: DISTINCT FirstName, COUNT(*)\n",
    "- **ORDER BY**: FirstName ASC\n",
    "- **LIMIT**: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "This order ensures that the SQL query is executed correctly and returns the expected results."
