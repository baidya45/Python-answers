    "## 1. What is multithreading in Python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multithreading** in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads (smallest unit of a process) within a single process. It allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This is useful for tasks that can be executed concurrently, like I/O-bound operations (e.g., reading from disk, network operations) or CPU-bound tasks (with some limitations due to the Global Interpreter Lock in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is it used?**\n",
    "- **Responsiveness:** Improves the responsiveness of applications, especially in cases like graphical user interfaces, where one thread can handle the interface while another performs a time-consuming task.\n",
    "- **Resource Sharing:** Multiple threads within a process share the same data space, which makes it easier to share data between threads than between processes.\n",
    "- **Efficient Utilization of Resources:** Particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, as while one thread is waiting for I/O, others can be doing useful work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Name the module used to handle threads in Python. Why is the `threading` module used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `threading` module in Python is used to handle threads. It provides a higher-level interface over the `thread` module and is easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is the `threading` module used?**\n",
    "- **Ease of Use:** It provides a convenient way to manage and work with threads. It offers classes and methods to create and control thread behavior easily.\n",
    "- **Synchronization:** It includes synchronization primitives like locks, events, conditions, and semaphores, which are essential for preventing race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "- **Better Abstraction:** It offers a cleaner, more object-oriented interface for working with threads compared to the lower-level `thread` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Use of the following functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`activeCount`:** Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive. This can be useful for monitoring the state of threads.\n",
    "- **`currentThread`:** Returns the current Thread object, corresponding to the callerâ€™s thread of control. This can be useful for getting the current thread's identity or checking its properties.\n",
    "- **`enumerate`:** Returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive. It includes both daemon and non-daemon threads. This function is useful for iterating over all active threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanation of the following functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`run`:** This method represents the thread's activity. It's the entry point for a thread. When a thread is started, the `run` method is called, and this method can be overridden to define the thread's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`start`:** This method starts the thread's activity. It calls the `run` method internally and should be called only once per thread object. If called multiple times, it raises a `RuntimeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`join`:** This method makes the calling thread wait until the thread whose `join` method is called is terminated. This is useful for ensuring that a thread has finished executing before the program continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`isAlive`:** This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the thread is still alive (i.e., it has been started and has not yet terminated). This can be used to check the status of a thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Python program to create two threads: one to print squares and another to print cubes\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function to print squares\n",
    "def print_squares(numbers):\n",
    "    for n in numbers:\n",
    "        print(f\"Square of {n}: {n ** 2}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function to print cubes\n",
    "def print_cubes(numbers):\n",
    "    for n in numbers:\n",
    "        print(f\"Cube of {n}: {n ** 3}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating two threads\n",
    "t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_squares, args=(numbers,))\n",
    "t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cubes, args=(numbers,))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Starting the threads\n",
    "t1.start()\n",
    "t2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait until both threads are done\n",
    "t1.join()\n",
    "t2.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Advantages and Disadvantages of Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Improved Performance:** Multithreading can improve the performance of applications by utilizing multiple threads for concurrent execution, especially in I/O-bound and network-bound tasks.\n",
    "- **Resource Sharing:** Threads can share resources such as memory, which allows for efficient resource usage.\n",
    "- **Responsiveness:** Applications can remain responsive while performing other tasks in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- **Complexity:** Multithreading adds complexity to program design and debugging. Issues like race conditions and deadlocks can be difficult to detect and resolve.\n",
    "- **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):** In CPython, the GIL prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously, limiting the performance benefits for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "- **Resource Overhead:** Creating and managing multiple threads can introduce additional overhead in terms of memory and CPU usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Deadlocks and Race Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deadlocks:** A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources. This can occur when multiple threads acquire locks in different orders and end up waiting indefinitely for each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Race Conditions:** A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it simultaneously. The outcome of the program depends on the order in which the threads execute, leading to unpredictable results. This can happen if proper synchronization mechanisms, like locks, are not used."
