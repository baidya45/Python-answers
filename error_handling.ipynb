    "### Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a custom exception in Python, it's essential to inherit from the `Exception` class, which is the base class for all built-in exceptions. This ensures that the custom exception behaves like other exceptions and can be caught and handled using the same mechanisms. By inheriting from `Exception`, the custom exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fits into the Exception Hierarchy**: It becomes part of Python's exception hierarchy, allowing it to be caught by generic exception handlers (e.g., `except Exception as e:`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consistent Behavior**: It inherits methods and properties from the `Exception` class, ensuring consistent behavior with other exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integration with Tools**: It integrates seamlessly with debugging and logging tools that are designed to work with exceptions derived from the `Exception` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Write a Python program to print the Python Exception Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import inspect\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(cls, indent=0):\n",
    "    print(' ' * indent + cls.__name__)\n",
    "    for subclass in cls.__subclasses__():\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "print_exception_hierarchy(BaseException)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ArithmeticError` class is the base class for all errors that occur for numeric calculations. It has several subclasses, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `OverflowError`\n",
    "- `ZeroDivisionError`\n",
    "- `FloatingPointError`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ZeroDivisionError**: Raised when division or modulo by zero takes place for all numeric types.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = 1 / 0\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **OverflowError**: Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be expressed within the available range.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import math\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = math.exp(1000)\n",
    "    except OverflowError as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Why is the LookupError class used? Explain with an example of KeyError and IndexError.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LookupError` class is the base class for all exceptions raised when a key or index used on a mapping or sequence is invalid. It helps to categorize errors related to lookups in dictionaries or sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **KeyError**: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        value = my_dict['c']\n",
    "    except KeyError as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **IndexError**: Raised when a sequence index is out of range.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        value = my_list[5]\n",
    "    except IndexError as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ImportError**: Raised when an import statement has trouble trying to load a module. This can happen due to a syntax error, missing module, or problems with the module's code.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **ModuleNotFoundError**: A subclass of `ImportError` introduced in Python 3.6, specifically raised when a module could not be found.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        import non_existent_module\n",
    "    except ModuleNotFoundError as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Specific Exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions rather than a generic `Exception` to handle anticipated errors.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = 1 / 0\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoid Bare Except**: Always specify the exception type instead of using a bare `except`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # some code\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Finally for Cleanup**: Use `finally` to release resources or perform cleanup actions.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "        # some operations with file\n",
    "    except IOError as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"File error: {e}\")\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        file.close()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Log Exceptions**: Log exceptions using the logging module instead of printing them, especially in production.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # some code\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        logging.error(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Avoid Swallowing Exceptions**: Do not ignore exceptions. Always handle them appropriately or propagate them.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # some code\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        # handle error or re-raise\n",
    "        raise\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Provide Useful Error Messages**: When raising exceptions, provide meaningful error messages to help with debugging.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if not isinstance(value, int):\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"The value must be an integer\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Use Custom Exceptions**: Define custom exceptions for specific error conditions in your application.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # some code\n",
    "    except CustomError as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Custom error: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```"
