    "### Q1. What is an Exception in Python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception:**\n",
    "An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:**\n",
    "- **Exceptions** occur during the execution of the program and can be caught and handled by the program. For example, division by zero, file not found, etc.\n",
    "- **Syntax Errors** are detected by the Python parser before the program execution. They indicate errors in the syntax of the code, such as missing colons, incorrect indentation, etc. Syntax errors must be corrected before the code can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled, the program terminates and an error message is displayed, which includes the type of the exception, the error message, and the traceback.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 5, in <module>\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` statements to catch and handle exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Division successful!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This will always be printed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cannot divide by zero!\n",
    "This will always be printed.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Explain with an example:\n",
    "#### try and else\n",
    "#### finally\n",
    "#### raise\n",
    "\n",
    "**try and else:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` block executes if the `try` block does not raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Division successful! The result is:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Division successful! The result is: 5.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**finally:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `finally` block executes no matter what, whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This will always be printed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cannot divide by zero!\n",
    "This will always be printed.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**raise:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `raise` statement allows you to trigger an exception manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_positive(number):\n",
    "    if number < 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"The number is not positive!\")\n",
    "    return number\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = check_positive(-5)\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The number is not positive!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in Python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Exceptions:**\n",
    "Custom exceptions are user-defined exceptions that are created by subclassing the built-in `Exception` class. They allow you to define your own error conditions and provide more meaningful error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need Custom Exceptions?**\n",
    "Custom exceptions make your code more readable and maintainable by providing specific error handling that is relevant to your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class NegativeNumberError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        super().__init__(f\"Negative number error: {self.value} is not allowed.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def check_positive(number):\n",
    "    if number < 0:\n",
    "        raise NegativeNumberError(number)\n",
    "    return number\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = check_positive(-5)\n",
    "except NegativeNumberError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Negative number error: -5 is not allowed.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Create a custom exception class. Use this class to handle an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Exception Class:**\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class InsufficientBalanceError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance, amount):\n",
    "        self.balance = balance\n",
